          Hello ðŸ‘‹, I'm Rushan. As a dedicated and self-motivated Software
          Engineer, I possess a versatile skill set and a strong desire to learn
          and grow within the field of software development. I have experience
          working with a variety of programming languages and software
          development practices, and I am committed to expanding my knowledge
          and skills in these areas. <br />
          <br />
          My software stack includes several programming languages, including
          Java, Python, and JavaScript, as well as libraries and frameworks such
          as Vue.js, Vuetify, React.js, and Express.js. I am also proficient in
          SQL Server, Jest, Docker, Git, and Linux. Through my experience with
          these technologies, I have gained valuable insights into software
          development best practices and effective project management
          techniques. <br />
          <br />
          As a lifelong learner, I am always seeking opportunities to improve my
          skills and stay up-to-date with the latest trends and developments in
          the field of software engineering. I believe that my passion for
          software development, coupled with my strong work ethic and commitment
          to excellence, make me a valuable asset to any team.
